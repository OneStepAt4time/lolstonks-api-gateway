# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines:

- By contributing code or docs you agree to license your contributions under the project's MIT License.
- Create small, focused PRs with a descriptive title and summary.
- Run tests and linters before opening a PR.

## Preferred workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-change
# make changes
# run tests/lint
git commit -am "feat: ..."
git push origin feat/your-change
# open PR
```

If you'd like, open an issue first to propose larger changes before coding.
