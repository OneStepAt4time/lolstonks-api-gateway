## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Create a feature branch from `main` or `develop`:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

**Branch naming conventions**:
- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

Before submitting, ensure your changes pass all checks:

```bash
# Run tests (when available)
pytest

# Run type checking (if configured)
mypy app

# Run linting (if configured)
ruff check app
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear commit messages following this format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for new Riot API endpoint"
git commit -m "fix: resolve rate limiting issue with burst requests"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
```

**Commit message format**:
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

Then open a pull request on GitHub with:

- Clear title describing the change
- Detailed description of what changed and why
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots or examples if applicable

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names

**Example**:

```python
from typing import Optional

async def get_summoner_by_name(
    summoner_name: str,
    region: str = "euw1"
) -> Optional[dict]:
    """
    Retrieve summoner information by name.

    Args:
        summoner_name: The summoner's in-game name
        region: The game region (default: euw1)

    Returns:
        Summoner data dictionary or None if not found
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples for complex features
- Keep line length reasonable (80-100 characters)
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Avoid jargon and explain technical terms

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure tests are isolated and reproducible
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external API calls

**Example test structure**:

```python
import pytest
from app.riot.client import RiotClient

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_summoner_by_name_success():
    """Test successful summoner retrieval."""
    client = RiotClient(api_key="test-key")
    # Test implementation
    pass

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_summoner_by_name_not_found():
    """Test summoner not found scenario."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### Updating Documentation

When making changes that affect documentation:

1. Update relevant `.md` files in the `docs/` directory
2. Test documentation locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

3. Ensure all links work correctly
4. Add code examples for new features
5. Update API reference if endpoints change

### Documentation Structure

- **Getting Started**: Installation and quick start guides
- **API Reference**: Endpoint documentation
- **Architecture**: System design and component documentation
- **Development**: Contributing and development guides
- **Operations**: Deployment and maintenance guides

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting**:
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation
   - Rebase on latest main/develop
   - Resolve any merge conflicts

2. **PR requirements**:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issue (if applicable)
   - Tests pass and coverage maintained
   - Documentation updated
   - Code reviewed by at least one maintainer

3. **After submission**:
   - Respond to review comments
   - Make requested changes
   - Keep PR updated with main branch
   - Be patient and respectful
