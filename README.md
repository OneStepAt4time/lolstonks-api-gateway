## About the Project

LOLStonks API Gateway is a focused, high-performance proxy for Riot's League of Legends HTTP APIs. It provides:

- A FastAPI front-end exposing the Riot endpoints with a stable surface for clients.
- Smart caching via Redis to reduce request volume and accelerate responses.
- Rate limiting using a token-bucket style algorithm to protect your Riot API key.
- Match tracking to persist processed match IDs and prevent double-processing.
- Automatic retry/backoff on 429s and useful metrics for observability.

This gateway is intended for use by any application interacting with Riot Games' League of Legends APIs. It can run standalone or alongside other services that need a robust, cache-aware Riot API proxy.

---

## Features

- FastAPI-based async proxy
- Redis TTL caching (summoners, matches, leagues) with sensible defaults
- Dual-layer match tracking: TTL cache + Redis SET for permanent storage of processed match IDs
- Rate limiting: token bucket defaults (20 req/s, 100 req/2min)
- Automatic retry on 429 responses with exponential backoff
- Multi-region support (EUW1, KR, NA1, BR1, and others)
- Docker Compose ready for easy deployment
- Comprehensive router coverage for Riot LoL endpoints

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.12+
1. Docker & Docker Compose (recommended)
1. A Riot Developer API key ([developer.riotgames.com](https://developer.riotgames.com/))
1. Optional: `uv` package manager (recommended in project)

### Local (Docker) Run

1. Copy `.env` and set your Riot key:

```powershell
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set RIOT_API_KEY
```

1. Start services with Docker Compose:

```powershell
docker-compose up -d
```

1. Health check:

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
# Expect: {"status":"ok"}
```

1. Open interactive API docs at: <http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs>

### Run Locally (venv)

1. Create virtualenv and install:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Copy `.env` and run:

```powershell
cp .env.example .env
# set RIOT_API_KEY in .env
python -m app.main
```

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit values as needed:

```env
# Required
RIOT_API_KEY=RGAPI-your-key-here

# Optional (defaults shown)
RIOT_DEFAULT_REGION=euw1
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8080
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

Notes:

- The gateway reads environment variables from `.env` via the `app.config` module.
- For production, prefer providing real environment variables instead of file-backed `.env`.

---

## Usage Examples

Get a summoner by name (region query param available):

```powershell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/lol/summoner/v4/summoners/by-name/Faker?region=kr"
```

Fetch Challenger players:

```powershell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/lol/league/v4/challengerleagues/by-queue/RANKED_SOLO_5x5?region=euw1"
```

Get match IDs by PUUID:

```powershell
PUUID="player-puuid-here"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/lol/match/v5/matches/by-puuid/$PUUID/ids?region=euw1&count=10"
```

## Architecture & Design

High-level components:

- `app.main`: FastAPI app entrypoint
- `app.config`: Environment and defaults loader
- `app.riot.client`: Request orchestration, retries, and rate limiting logic
- `app.cache.redis_cache`: TTL caching primitives
- `app.cache.tracking`: Permanent match tracking set + TTL processed cache
- `app.routers.*`: Individual API routers that map to Riot endpoints

Design goals:

- Keep client callers decoupled from Riot's rate and cache concerns
- Let Redis provide the fast-path for repeated lookups
- Provide transparent retry behavior for 429s so clients don't need to re-implement it

---

## Development

Recommended workflow:

1. Create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature
```

1. Run the app locally (see Quick Start)
1. Add tests under `tests/` and run them via your preferred test runner

Linting & type checking:

- Project follows modern Python typing; run mypy/ruff/flake8 if configured in your environment

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read the repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if present) and follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo
1. Create a branch for your change
1. Run tests and linters
1. Open a pull request with a clear description

## Troubleshooting

- 401 from Riot: check `RIOT_API_KEY` is valid and not restricted.
- 429 frequently: verify the gateway is not misconfigured and your key isn't being used elsewhere; consider increasing rate limits if allowed by Riot or caching more responses.
- Redis connection errors: check `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT` and that Redis is running.

If you hit problems you can't resolve locally, open an issue with logs and reproduction steps.

---

## Roadmap (ideas)

- Metrics (Prometheus) and tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Admin endpoints to inspect/flush caches
- Pluggable storage backends for match tracking
- Support for automatic API key rotation
